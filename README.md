# Color My Views

This app is a version of the third project in [**Developing Android Apps with Kotlin**](https://eu.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012) by
**Udacity** and **Google**. User can tap on boxes and buttons to randomly change their colors. Tapping on the four color buttons at the bottom will recreate the famous painting from [**Piet Mondrian: Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian). 
The reset button will return the boxes at their initial state.
